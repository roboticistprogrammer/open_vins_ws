# OpenVINS

Welcome to the OpenVINS project!
The OpenVINS project houses some core computer vision code along with a state-of-the art filter-based visual-inertial
estimator. The core filter is an [Extended Kalman filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Kalman_filter) which
fuses inertial information with sparse visual feature tracks. These visual feature tracks are fused leveraging
the [Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (MSCKF)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4209642) sliding window
formulation which allows for 3D features to update the state estimate without directly estimating the feature states in
the filter. Inspired by graph-based optimization systems, the included filter has modularity allowing for convenient
covariance management with a proper type-based state system.

## Codebase Extensions

* **[ov_plane](https://github.com/rpng/ov_plane)** - A real-time monocular visual-inertial odometry (VIO) system which leverages
  environmental planes. At the core it presents an efficient robust monocular-based plane detection algorithm which does
  not require additional sensing modalities such as a stereo, depth camera or neural network. The plane detection and tracking
  algorithm enables real-time regularization of point features to environmental planes which are either maintained in the state
  vector as long-lived planes, or marginalized for efficiency. Planar regularities are applied to both in-state SLAM and
  out-of-state MSCKF point features, enabling long-term point-to-plane loop-closures due to the large spacial volume of planes.

* **[vicon2gt](https://github.com/rpng/vicon2gt)** - This utility was created to generate groundtruth trajectories using
  a motion capture system (e.g. Vicon or OptiTrack) for use in evaluating visual-inertial estimation systems.
  Specifically we calculate the inertial IMU state (full 15 dof) at camera frequency rate and generate a groundtruth
  trajectory similar to those provided by the EurocMav datasets. Performs fusion of inertial and motion capture
  information and estimates all unknown spacial-temporal calibrations between the two sensors.

* **[ov_maplab](https://github.com/rpng/ov_maplab)** - This codebase contains the interface wrapper for exporting
  visual-inertial runs from [OpenVINS](https://github.com/rpng/open_vins) into the ViMap structure taken
  by [maplab](https://github.com/ethz-asl/maplab). The state estimates and raw images are appended to the ViMap as
  OpenVINS runs through a dataset. After completion of the dataset, features are re-extract and triangulate with
  maplab's feature system. This can be used to merge multi-session maps, or to perform a batch optimization after first
  running the data through OpenVINS. Some example have been provided along with a helper script to export trajectories
  into the standard groundtruth format.

* **[ov_secondary](https://github.com/rpng/ov_secondary)** - This is an example secondary thread which provides loop
  closure in a loosely coupled manner for [OpenVINS](https://github.com/rpng/open_vins). This is a modification of the
  code originally developed by the HKUST aerial robotics group and can be found in
  their [VINS-Fusion](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Fusion) repository. Here we stress that this is a
  loosely coupled method, thus no information is returned to the estimator to improve the underlying OpenVINS odometry.
  This codebase has been modified in a few key areas including: exposing more loop closure parameters, subscribing to
  camera intrinsics, simplifying configuration such that only topics need to be supplied, and some tweaks to the loop
  closure detection to improve frequency.
